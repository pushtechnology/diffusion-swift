/**
 @brief The Client Control feature provides the ability for a client session
        to control other client sessions.

 It allows for notifications of client sessions starting and closing as well
 as the ability to manage client sessions (forcibly closing them etc).


 ### Access control

 A session must have `PTDiffusionGlobalPermission#viewSession` permission to be able
 to listen for notifications using `#addSessionPropertiesListener:forProperties:completionHandler:`
 or `#getSessionProperties:forSession:completionHandler:` of sessions
 or listen for queue events. In addition, `PTDiffusionGlobalPermission#registerHandler`
 permission is required to set a session properties listener or queue event handler.

 In order to perform operations that change a session's state (such as throttling,
 conflating, or closing the session, or changing roles), both
 `PTDiffusionGlobalPermission#viewSession` and PTDiffusionGlobalPermission#modifySession`
 permission is required.


 ### Accessing the feature

 This feature may be obtained from a `PTDiffusionSession` session as follows:
 <pre>
    <code>
        PTDiffusionClientControlFeature *clientControl = session.clientControl;
    </code>
 </pre>

@interface PTDiffusionClientControlFeature : PTDiffusionFeature


/**
 @brief Register a listener that will be notified when client sessions are
        opened, disconnected, reconnected, closed or when selected session
        property values are updated.

 When a listener is first set, it will be called with the required
 properties of all currently open client sessions.
 The amount of data transferred from the server is proportional to
 the number of connected clients and is potentially large.
 The amount of data can be reduced using `requiredProperties` parameter.

 Each control session can register a single listener. When the listener is
 no longer required, it may be closed using the
 PTDiffusionSessionPropertiesListenerRegistration provided by the `completionHandler`.
 To change the listener, the previous listener must first be closed.

 The `requiredProperties` parameter is used to select the property
 values required.

 The requested property set controls the level of detail provided and
 whether the listener is called for updates to sessions.
 If no properties are requested, the listener is not called when
 session properties are updated.

 @param listener the listener to be called with session notifications

 @param requiredProperties a list of required property keys.
        See `PTDiffusionSession` for a full list of available fixed property keys.
        To request no properties, supply an empty list.
        To request all fixed properties, include
        `PTDiffusionSession.allFixedProperties` as an entry.
        In this case any other fixed property keys would be ignored.
        To request all user properties, include
        `PTDiffusionSession.allUserProperties` as an entry.
        In this case any other user properties are ignored.

 @param completionHandler a completion handler than returns when the listener
        has been registered, returning a `PTDiffusionSessionPropertiesListenerRegistration`
        which can be used to unregister the listener.

        If the `registration` is nil. This could mean an error has occurred during the
        registration process. These may include:
        - SessionClosed, if the session is closed
        - HandlerConflict, if the session has already registered a queue event handler
        - Security, if the session does not have
          `PTDiffusionGlobalPermission.registerHandler` permission and/or
          `PTDiffusionGlobalPermission.viewSession` permission.
