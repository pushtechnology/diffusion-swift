/**
 @brief A client session to a server or cluster of servers.

 The @ref md_quick_start "Quick Start" guide provides basic instructions on how
 to connect to a Diffusion server.

 Also see:
 - @ref md_session_filters "Session Filters".
 - @ref md_session_properties "Session Properties".

 A new session can be created by connecting to a server using
 `#openWithURL:completionHandler:` specifying the server URL.
 A `PTDiffusionSessionConfiguration` can also be configured to control
 the behaviour of the session using `#openWithURL:configuration:completionHandler:`

 The session provides a variety of operations to the application. These are
 grouped into feature interfaces, such as Topics and Messaging,
 exposed to the application through the following methods:
 <ul>
     <li>#clientControl
     <li>#messaging
     <li>#pings
     <li>#remoteServers
     <li>#security
     <li>#subscriptionControl
     <li>#timeSeries
     <li>#topicControl
     <li>#topics
     <li>#topicUpdate
     <li>#topicViews
 </ul>

 ###Session lifecycle

 Each session is managed by a server. The server assigns the session a
 unique identity, and manages the session's topic subscriptions,
 security details, and session properties.

 A session can be terminated using `close`. A session may also be
 terminated by the server because of an error or a time out, or by other
 privileged sessions using the ClientControl feature.

 A client can become disconnected from the server, and reconnect to the server
 without loss of the session. Reconnection can be configured using
 `PTDiffusionSessionConfiguration.reconnectionStrategy`. The server
 must be configured to allow reconnection.

 If a session is connected to a server that belongs to a cluster with session
 replication enabled, and then becomes disconnected, it will attempt to
 reconnect to the original server. A properly configured load balancer can
 detect that the original server is unavailable and re-route the reconnection
 request to a second server in the cluster. The second server can recover
 session data and continue the session. This process is known as "fail over".
 Unlike reconnection, in-flight messages can be lost during failover, and the
 application will be unsubscribed and re-subscribed to topics.

 The current state of the session can be retrieved with `state`.
 This property is Key-Value Observable with changes being notified on
 the main dispatch queue when the session state changes.


 ### Session properties

 For each session, the server stores a set of session properties that describe
 various attributes of the session.


 There are two types of session property. Fixed properties are assigned by
 Diffusion. User-defined properties are assigned by the application.


 Many operations use session filter expressions that use session properties to select sessions.


 A privileged client can monitor other sessions, including changes to their
 session properties, using a session event listener. When registering to receive session properties,
 special key values of {@link #allFixedProperties} and {@link #allUserProperties} can be used.


 Each property is identified by a key. Most properties have a single string
 value. The exception is the $Roles fixed property which has a set of string values.

 Fixed properties are identified by keys with a '$' prefix. The available fixed session properties are:

 | Key              | Description                                                                                                                                   |
 |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | `$ClientIP`      | The Internet address of the client in string format.                                                                                          |
 | `$ClientType`    | The client type of the session. One of `ANDROID`, `C`, `DOTNET`, `IOS`, `JAVA`, `JAVASCRIPT_BROWSER`, `MQTT`, `PYTHON`, `REST`, `OTHER`.      |
 | `$Environment`   | The environment in which the client is running. For possible values see the <a href="https://docs.diffusiondata.com/docs/latest/manual/html/developerguide/client/basics/uci_session_properties.html">user manual.</a>    |
 | `$Connector`     | The configuration name of the server connector that the client connected to.                                                                  |
 | `$Country`       | The country code for the country where the client's Internet address was allocated (for example, `NZ` for New Zealand). Country codes are as defined by Locale. If the country code could not be determined, this will be a zero length string.   |
 | `$GatewayType`   | Gateway client type. Only set for gateway client sessions. If present it indicates the type of gateway client (e.g. Kafka).                   |
 | `$GatewayId`     | The identity of a gateway client session. Only present if the `$GatewayType` session property is present.                                     |
 | `$Language`      | The language code for the official language of the country where the client's Internet address was allocated (for example, `en` for English). Language codes are as defined by Locale. If the language could not be determined or is not applicable, this will be a zero length string.   |
 | `$Latitude`      | The client's latitude, if available. This will be the string representation of a floating point number and will be `NaN` if not available.    |
 | `$Longitude`     | The client's longitude, if available. This will be the string representation of a floating point number and will be `NaN` if not available.   |
 | `$MQQTClientId`  | The MQTT client identifier. Only set for MQTT sessions. If present, the value of the `$ClientType` session property will be `MQTT`.           |
 | `$Principal`     | The security principal associated with the client session.                                                                                    |
 | `$Roles`         | Authorisation roles assigned to the session. This is a set of roles represented as quoted strings (for example, `"role1","role2"`).           |
 | `$ServerName`    | The name of the server to which the session is connected.                                                                                     |
 | `$SessionId`     | The session identifier.                                                                                                                       |
 | `$StartTime`     | The session's start time in milliseconds since the epoch.                                                                                     |
 | `$Transport`     | The session transport type. One of `WEBSOCKET`, `HTTP_LONG_POLL`, `TCP`, or `OTHER`.                                                          |


 All user-defined property keys are non-empty strings. The characters ' ', \\t, \\r, \\n, \", ', (, ) are not allowed.


 Session properties are initially associated with a session as follows:
 1. When a client starts a new session, it can optionally propose user-defined session properties. Session properties proposed in this way must be accepted by the authenticator. This safeguard prevents abuse by a rogue, unprivileged client.
 2. Diffusion allocates all fixed property values.
 3. The new session is authenticated by registered authenticators. An authenticator that accepts a session can veto or change the user-defined session properties and add new user-defined session properties. The authenticator can also change certain fixed properties.


 Once a session is established, its user-defined session properties can be modified by clients
 with `VIEW_SESSION` and `MODIFY_SESSION` permissions. A privileged client can also modify its own session properties.


 If a session re-authenticates, the authenticator that allows the re-authentication can modify the user-defined
 session properties and a subset of the fixed properties as mentioned above.


 ### Session filters

 Session filters are a mechanism of addressing a set of sessions by the values
 of their session properties.

 Session filters are specified using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). For a full and
 detailed description of the session filters DSL see the [user manual](https://docs.diffusiondata.com/docs/latest/manual/html/developerguide/client/basics/uci_session_filtering.html).


 ### Session locks

 The actions of multiple sessions can be coordinated using session locks. See
 PTDiffusionSession#lockWithName:completionHandler:

/**

 @since 6.0
 */
@property(nonatomic, weak) id<PTDiffusionErrorListener> errorListener;


/**

 @since 5.6
 */
-(void)close;


/**
 Attempt to acquire a session lock.

 The completion handler block will be called with the requested lock if the
 server assigns it to the session. Otherwise, the completion handler block will
 be called with an error indicating why the lock could not be acquired.

 Acquiring the lock can take an arbitrarily long time if other sessions are
 competing for the lock. The server will retain the session's request for the
 lock until it is assigned to the session, the session is closed, or the session
 cancels the CompletableFuture.

 A session can call this method multiple times. If the lock is acquired, all
 calls will complete successfully with equal SessionLocks.

 Calling cancel on the returned PTDiffusionCancellable has no effect on other
 pending calls to acquire this lock.

 Upon successful acquisition, the session owns the lock and is responsible for
 unlocking it. When calling cancel on the returned PTDiffusionCancellable, take
 care that it has not already completed by checking the return value. The
 following Swift code releases the lock if the request could not be canceled.

 let attempt = session.lock(withName: "my-lock") { (lock, error) in
 / / ..
 }

 if (!attempt.cancel()) {
    attempt.lock?.unlock() { (wasOwned, error) in }
 }

 A session that acquires a lock will remain its owner until it is unlocked or
 the session closes. The variant of this methods that takes a scope parameter
 provides the further option of releasing the lock when the session loses its
 connection to the server.

 ### Access control

 To allow fine-grained access control, lock names are interpreted as path names,
 controlled with the `PTDiffusionPathPermission.acquireLock` path permission. This allows permission to
 be granted to a session to acquire the lock `update-topic/a` while preventing
 the session from acquiring the lock `update-topic/b`, for example.

 @param name The name of the session lock.

 @param completionHandler Block to be called asynchronously on success or
 failure. If the operation was successful, the `error` argument passed to the
 block will be `nil`. The completion handler will be called asynchronously on
 the main dispatch queue.

 If this session has successfully acquired the session lock, or this session
 already owns the session lock, the completion handler will be called with the
 lock instance.

 If the completion handler is called with an error to indicate failure, this
 session does not own the session lock. Common reasons for failure include:

 - The calling session does not have the `PTDiffusionPathPermission.acquireLock` permission for this lock
 name.
 - The session is closed.

 @exception NSInvalidArgumentException Raised if any supplied arguments are `nil`.

/**
 Variant of #lockWithName:completionHandler: that provides control over when a
 lock will be released.

 If called with PTDiffusionSessionLockScope#unlockOnSessionLoss, this method
 behaves exactly like #lockWithName:completionHandler:.

 If called with PTDiffusionSessionLockScope#unlockOnConnectionLoss, any lock
 that is returned will be unlocked if the session loses its connection to the
 server. This is useful to allow another session to take ownership of the lock
 while this session is reconnecting.

 @param name The name of the session lock

 @param scope Preferred scope. The scope of a lock controls when it will be
 released automatically. If a session makes multiple requests for a lock using
 different scopes, and the server assigns the lock to the session fulfilling the
 requests, the lock will be given the weakest scope
 (PTDiffusionSessionLockScope#unlockOnConnectionLoss).

 @param completionHandler Block to be called asynchronously on success or
 failure. If the operation was successful, the `error` argument passed to the
 block will be `nil`. The completion handler will be called asynchronously on
 the main dispatch queue.
