/**
 @brief This feature allows a client session to configure session trees.

 A session tree is a virtual view of the topic tree presented to a session by
 fetch and subscription operations. Custom session trees for different
 sessions can be configured using declarative rules maintained by the server
 to meet data security, data optimisation, or personalisation and localisation
 requirements. Each session can be presented with a unique session tree based
 on its session properties.

 A session tree is produced by applying <em>branch mappings</em> to the topic
 tree. Branch mappings are organised into <em>branch mapping tables</em>. Each
 branch mapping table is assigned to a unique path â€“ the <em>session tree branch</em>.

 A session tree is composed of <em>session paths</em>. Each session path is
 mapped via the branch mapping tables to a unique <em>topic path</em>.

 A branch mapping table is an ordered list of (session filter, topic tree branch)
 pairs. For example, the branch mapping table for the session tree branch
 <code>market/prices</code> might be:

 <pre>
 Session filter                           Topic tree branch
 =========                                =============
 USER_TIER is '1' or $Country is 'DE'     backend/discounted_prices
 USER_TIER is '2'                         backend/standard_prices
 $Principal is ''                         backend/delayed_prices
 </pre>

 With this configuration, if an unauthenticated session (one that matches the
 <code>$Principal is ''</code> session filter) subscribes to the session path
 <code>market/prices/X</code>, and there is a topic bound to the topic path
 <code>backend/delayed_prices/X</code>, the subscription will complete. The session
 will receive a subscription notification under the session path
 <code>market/prices/X</code>, together with the topic properties and the value of
 the topic. The session is unaware that the data originates from a topic bound
 to a different topic path. If no topic is bound to
 <code>backend/delayed_prices/X</code>, the subscription will not resolve and the
 session will receive no data, even if there is a topic bound to
 <code>market/prices/X</code>.

 Session trees complement the data transformation capabilities of
 {@link PTDiffusionTopicViewsFeature topic views}. In our example, the time delayed
 time feed at <code>backend/delayed_prices</code> could be maintained by a topic
 view using the <em>delay by</em> clause.

 Branch mappings are persisted by the server and shared across a cluster, in a
 similar manner to topic views, security stores, and metric collectors. Branch
 mappings are editable using this feature, and via the management console.

 For a given session and session path, at most one branch mapping applies. The
 applicable branch mapping is chosen as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>Each branch mapping table with session tree branch that is a prefix of the
 session path is considered. For a given table, the first branch mapping with
 a condition that matches the session's properties is the one that applies. A
 branch mapping table may have no applicable branch mappings for a session.
 <li>If there are several such branch mapping tables with a branch mapping
 that for the session, the one with the longest prefix of the session path
 applies.
 <li>If no branch mapping table has a branch mapping for the session, the
 session path is translated to the identical topic path.
 </ul>

 ### Access control

 To subscribe to or fetch from a session path, a session must be granted the
 appropriate path permission to the session path for the operation
 ({@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#selectTopic SELECT_TOPIC}, or
 {@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#readTopic READ_TOPIC}). The session
 doesn't require any permissions to the topic path of the topic providing
 the data.

 To create or replace branch mappings, a session needs the
 {@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#modifyTopic MODIFY_TOPIC} path permission
 for the session tree branch of the branch mapping table,
 {@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#exposeBranch EXPOSE_BRANCH} path permission
 for the topic tree branch of each branch mapping, and (if an existing table with
 the same session tree branch is being replaced)
 {@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#exposeBranch EXPOSE_BRANCH} permission for
 each branch mapping of existing table.

 To retrieve a branch mapping table, a session needs the
 {@link PTDiffusionPathPermission#readTopic READ_TOPIC} path permission for
 its session tree branch.

 ### Accessing the feature

 This feature may be obtained from a {@link PTDiffusionSession session} as follows:
 <pre>
 PTDiffusionSessionTreesFeature *const sessionTrees = session.sessionTrees;
 </pre>
