 has the permission for all descendant paths. From a security perspective,
 if a role grants <code>EXPOSE_BRANCH</code> at branch <code>X</code> it is
 ineffectual for it also to deny <code>EXPOSE_BRANCH</code> at a child branch
 <code>X/Y</code> because a branch mapping to <code>X</code> can still expose paths
 below <code>X/Y</code>.
