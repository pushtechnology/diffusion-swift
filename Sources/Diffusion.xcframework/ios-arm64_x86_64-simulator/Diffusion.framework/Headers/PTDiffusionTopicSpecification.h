/**
 @brief Topic specifications provide the information required to create a topic.

 Topics can be created from a topic specification using
 `[PTDiffusionTopicControlFeature addTopicWithPath:specification:completionHandler:]`.

 Topic specifications allow an application to introspect the type and
 capabilities of a topic. Topic specifications are provided to
 value streams and topic notification listeners.

 A topic specification has a topic type and a map of
 property settings which define the behavior of the topic. A default topic
 specification for a topic type can be created using
 `[PTDiffusionTopicSpecification initWithType:]`. Topic specifications with
 different properties can be derived from a default instance using the
 `[PTdiffusionTopicSpecification initWithType:properties:]` builder method.

 ###Topic Properties

 Depending on the topic type, some properties must be included in the
 specification when creating a topic and some properties have no effect. The
 required and optional properties for each the topic type are set out in the
 following table. Properties unsupported by the topic type are ignored.

/**
 Key of boolean topic property indicating whether a topic should publish only
 values.

 By default, a topic that supports delta streams will publish the
 difference between two values (a delta) when doing so is more efficient
 than publishing the complete new value. Subscribing sessions can use a
 value stream to automatically apply the delta to a
 local copy of the topic value to calculate the new value.

 Setting this property to `true` disables this behavior so that deltas are never
 published. Doing so is usually not recommended because it will result in more
 data being transmitted, less efficient use of network resources, and increased
 transmission latency. On the other hand, calculating deltas can require
 significant CPU from the server or, if update streams are used, from the
 updating client. The CPU cost will be higher if there are many differences
 between successive values, in which case delta streams confer fewer benefits.
 If successive values are unrelated to each other, consider setting this
 property to `true`. Also consider setting this property to `true` if the
 network capacity is high and the bandwidth savings of deltas are not required.

 additional validation on values to check that it is a valid instance of the
 data type, and if it is not then it will return an error to the updater and not
 update the topic.

 If this value is not set (or set to something other than `true`), no server
 validation of inbound values is performed. This is the recommended setting as
 there is a performance overhead to validation and a client using a value

 When a new event is added to the time series, older events that fall outside of
 the range are discarded.

 If this property is not specified, a time series topic will retain the ten most
 recent events.

 The value of this property is a time series range expression string composed of
 one or more constraint clauses. Constraints are combined to provide a range of
 events from the end of the time series.

 <dl>
    <dt>limit constraint</dt>
    <dd>A limit constraint specifies the maximum number of events from the
        end of the time series.</dd>

    <dd>A last constraint specifies the maximum duration of events from the
        end of the time series. The duration is expressed as an integer followed
        by one of the following time units:
        <ul>
            <li>`MS` &ndash; milliseconds</li>

            <li>`H` &ndash; hours.</li>
        </ul>

/**
 Key of boolean topic property that specifies a topic should not retain

 By default, a topic will retain its latest value.
 The latest value will be sent to new subscribers. Setting
 this property to `true` disables this behavior. New subscribers
 will not be sent an  initial value. No value will be returned for fetch
 operations that select the topic. This is useful for data streams where
 the values are only transiently valid.

 Setting this property to `true` also disables delta streams, regardless of the
 #publishValuesOnlyPropertyKey value. If subsequent values are likely to be
 related, delta streams usually provide performance benefits (see
 #publishValuesOnlyPropertyKey). Consider leaving this property set to `false`
 to benefit from delta streams, even if there is no other requirement to retain
 the last value.

 Bearing in mind the performance trade-offs of disabling delta streams, there
 are two reasons to consider setting this property to `true`. First, it stops
 the server and each subscribed client from keeping a copy of the value,
 reducing their memory requirements. Second, when a topic has a high update rate
 and is replicated across a cluster, it can significantly improve throughput
 because the values need not be persisted to the cluster.

/**
 Key of the topic property that specifies a removal policy for automatic
 removal of the topic (and/or other topics).

 This property is specified as an expression which defines one or more
 conditions that are to be satisfied before automatic removal occurs.

 The expression takes the form:

     when <conditions> [remove "<selector>"]

 At least one *condition* must be supplied. If more than one is supplied, they
 must be separated by logical operators (`and` or `or`). The natural evaluation
 order of the operators may be changed by surrounding with parentheses (e.g.
 (*condition* `and` *condition*)).

 The `remove` clause is optional. It provides a
 @ref md_topic_selectors "topic selector" expression to be evaluated by the
 server, representing the topics to be removed. If a `remove` clause is
 specified, the topic with the removal policy will only be removed if its path
 matches the selector expression. The selector must be surrounded by either
 double or single quotes.

 When many topics have the same removal policy, it is better to
 set the `REMOVAL` property for one of them, using a `remove`
 clause that selects all of the topics. This is more efficient because it
 allows the server to avoid evaluating the same condition many times.

 The permissions that are applied at the time of removal are those defined by
 the roles of the principal that created the topic at the time of creation. The
 roles of that principal may therefore change before the removal with no effect,
 but if the permissions given to the roles change it may have an effect upon the
 final removal.

 </table>

 Time periods are specified as a number followed (with no intermediate space) by
 a single letter representing the time unit. The time unit may be `s` (seconds),
 `m` (minutes), `h` (hours) or `d` (days). For example, 10 minutes would be
 specified as `10m`.

 If quotes or backslashes (`\`) are required within quoted values such as
 selectors or session criteria then they may be escaped by preceding with `\`.
 The convenience method `PTDiffusionEscape` is provided to escape such
 characters in a value.

 The expression is validated only by the server and therefore if an invalid
 expression is specified it will be reported asynchronously as an error.

 ### Examples

     when time after 1518780068112

 The topic will be removed when the date and time indicated by the specified
 number of milliseconds since the epoch has passed.

     when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT"

 The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed and the
 topic has had no subscriptions for a continuous period of 30 minutes after that
 time.

     when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" and subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h

 after that time plus one hour.

     when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" or subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h

 The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed or the
 topic has had less than 2 subscriptions for a continuous period of 10 minutes
 after one hour from its creation.

     when time after "Tue, 3 Jun 2018 11:05:30 GMT" and (subscriptions < 2 for 10m after 1h or no updates for 20m)

 The topic will be removed when the specified date and time has passed and
 either the topic has had less than 2 subscriptions for a continuous period of
 10 minutes after that time plus one hour or it has had no updates for a
 continuous period of 20 minutes. Note that the parentheses are significant here
 as without them the topic would be removed if it had had no updates for 20
 minutes regardless of the time and subscriptions clause.

 ### Notes and restrictions on use

 The `after` time periods refer to the period since the topic was created or
 restored from persistence store after a server is restarted. They are designed
 as a 'grace' period after the topic comes into existence before the related
 condition starts to be evaluated. When not specified the conditions start to be
 evaluated as soon as the topic is created or restored.

 The server will evaluate conditions on a periodic basis (every few seconds) so
 the exact removal time will not be precise for low periodic granularity.

 The meaning of the `for` period in a `no session has` condition is subtly
 different from its use in other conditions. It does not guarantee that there
 has been no session satisfying the condition at some point between evaluations,
 only that when evaluated the given period of time has passed since it was last
 evaluated and found to have no matching sessions.

 Subscriptions is the number of subscriptions to a topic.
 When monitoring across a cluster the `subscriptions less than` condition is first
 checked on the server that owns the topic and if satisfied there then each cluster
 member is queried to check if the condition has also been satisfied there.
 The topic will only be removed if the total number of subscriptions across the
 cluster is less than that specified in the condition.

 Automatic topic removal is supported for a topic that is replicated
 across the local cluster, and for a topic with with fanout replicas on
 downstream remote servers. A `subscriptions less than` condition will be evaluated
 against the total number of subscriptions across the cluster and on all
 fanout replicas on downstream remote servers. A `no session has`
 condition will consider all sessions hosted across the cluster and all
 sessions hosted by downstream remote servers that have a fanout replica
 of the topic. The `local` keyword can be used to restrict evaluation to
 the local cluster, ignoring fanout replicas.

/**
 Key of the topic property that specifies the conflation policy of the
 topic. The policy specifies how the server manages queued topic updates.
 Conflation is applied individually to each session queue.

 Conflation is the process of merging or discarding topic updates queued
 for a session to reduce the server memory footprint and network data. The
 server will conflate sessions that have a large number of queued messages
 to meet configured queue size targets. The sessions with the largest
 queues are typically slow consumers or have been disconnected – both will
 benefit from conflation. This property allows conflation behavior to be
 tuned on a topic-by-topic basis.

 The supported policies are:
 <ul>
    <li>`off`
    <li>`conflate`
    <li>`unsubscribe`
    <li>`always`
 </ul>

 The default policy used when the property is not specified and the
 topic type is not time series is `conflate`. The default policy
 used when the property is not specified and the topic type is time
 series is `off`.

 The policy `off` disables conflation for the topic. This policy
 disables all conflation for the topic, so topic updates will never be
 merged or discarded.

 The policy `conflate` automatically conflates topic updates when
 back pressure is detected by the server.

 The policy `unsubscribe` automatically unsubscribes the topic when
 back pressure is detected by the server. The unsubscription is not
 persisted to the cluster. If a session fails over to a different server
 it will be resubscribed to the topic.

 The policy `always` automatically conflates topic updates as they
 are queued for the session. This is an eager policy that ensures only the
 latest update is queued for the topic, minimising the server memory and
 network bandwidth used by the session.

 The `conflate` and `unsubscribe` policies are applied when
 the server detects back pressure for a session. The server configuration
 places limits on the data queued for each session. If these limits are
 breached, the server will conflate the session queue to attempt to reduce
 its size. If the session queue still exceeds the limits after conflation,
 the session will be terminated.

 Conflation can be disabled on a session-by-session basis. If conflation is disabled for a
 session the policy will not be applied to topic updates queued for the
 session but will be for other sessions that have conflation enabled.

 The policies `conflate` and `always` are not supported for
 time series topics as they would cause missing events. Attempts to enable
 these policies with time series topics will cause the creation of the
 topic to fail, reporting that the specification is invalid.

/**
 Key of the topic property that allows the creator of a topic to extend
 `PTDiffusionPathPermission#readTopic`, `PTDiffusionPathPermission#modifyTopic`
 and `PTDiffusionPathPermission#updateTopic` permissions to a specific
 principal, in addition to the permissions granted by the authorisation rules in
 the security store.

 A session that has authenticated using the principal can update and remove the
 topic, so the principal can be considered the topic owner. To fetch or
 subscribe to the topic, the principal must also be granted the `SELECT_TOPIC`
 permission by the security store rules.

 This may be used in the following cases:

 1. A session creates a topic and makes its own principal the owner.
 2. A session creates a topic and makes another principal the owner.

 The format of the property value is:

     $Principal is "<name>"

 where *name* is the name of the principal. Single quotes may be used instead of
 double quotes and special characters must be escaped. The convenience method
 `PTDiffusionEscape` is provided to escape such characters in a value.

 The purpose of this property is to allow a client to create topics on behalf of
 other users. This can be used in conjunction with #removalPropertyKey so that
 such topics are removed when there are no longer any sessions for the named
 principal.

 For example:

     PTDiffusionTopicSpecification *const specification =
         [[PTDiffusionTopicSpecification alloc] initWithType:topicType
                                                  properties:@ {
             [PTDiffusionTopicSpecification ownerPropertyKey] :
                 @"$Principal is 'myPrincipal'",
             [PTDiffusionTopicSpecification removalPropertyKey] :
                 @"when no session has '$Principal is \"myPrincipal\"' for 5s"

/**
 Key of the topic property that allows the compression policy to be set
 on a per-topic basis.

 Compression reduces the bandwidth required to broadcast topic updates to
 subscribed sessions, at the cost of increased server CPU.

 Changes to a topic's value are published to each subscribed session as a
 sequence of topic messages. A topic message can carry the latest value or
 the difference between the latest value and the previous value (a delta).
 The compression policy determines if and how published topic messages
 are compressed. Topic messages are not exposed through the client API;
 the client library handles decompression and decodes deltas
 automatically, passing reconstructed values to the application.

 The compression policy for a topic is specified by setting this property
 to one of several values:

 - `off`
 - `low`
 - `medium`
 - `high`

 The policies are listed in the order of increasing compression and
 increasing CPU cost. `off` disables compression completely for the
 topic and requires no additional CPU; `high` compresses the topic
 messages to the smallest number of bytes, but has the highest CPU cost.
 Generally some compression is beneficial, so the default value for this
 property is `low`.

 Prior to version 6.4, only two values were allowed: `true`
 (equivalent to `medium`, and the previous default policy) and
 `false` (equivalent to `off`). These values are still
 supported.

 This property is only one factor that determines whether a topic message
 will be compressed. Other factors include:

 - Compression must be enabled in the server configuration.

 - The client library must support the server's compression
   scheme. In this release, the server supports zlib
   compression, and also allows compression to be disabled on a
   per-connector basis. From 6.4, all client libraries are
   capable of zlib compression. A JavaScript client may or may
   not support zlib compression, depending on whether the zlib
   library can be loaded. The zlib library is packaged
   separately to reduce the download size of the core library.

 the compression policy to be set on a per-topic basis.

/**
 Key of the topic property that specifies the topic delivery priority.

 The supported delivery priorities are:
 - **low**
 - **default**
 - **high**

 The delivery priority affects the order of topic updates sent to a
 subscribed client session. When there are multiple topic updates for
 topics with different priorities in a session's outbound queue, updates
 for "high" priority topics will be delivered first, followed by
 updates for "default" priority topics, followed by updates for
 "low" priority topics. Topic subscription and unsubscription
 notifications are also delivered according to the topic delivery
 priority.

 Using different delivery priorities is most beneficial when there is a
 large backlog of queued updates to deliver to a client session. On
 lightly loaded systems, updates typically remain in the outbound queue
 for a few milliseconds and so there is a lower chance of topic updates
 being reordered based on their priority. The backlog will be larger if
 the topic update rate is higher; the server or the client are more
 heavily loaded; the client session becomes temporarily disconnected; or
 if there is poor network connectivity between the server and the client.

 Messages from the server to the client that are not topic updates, for
 example ping requests and responses, are queued with the
 "default" delivery priority.
