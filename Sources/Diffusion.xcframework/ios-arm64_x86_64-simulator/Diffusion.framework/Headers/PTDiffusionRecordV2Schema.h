/**
 @brief A schema.
 
 A schema describes data value format in terms of one or more record definitions.
 A record definition describes the layout of a record and comprises one or more
 field definitions.

 Within the data value there can be multiple occurrences of a record or field
 described by a single definition. The defined (or allowed, when describing
 variable numbers) number of occurrences of each definition is referred to as
 its 'multiplicity'. The multiplicity can be fixed (the item occurs a fixed
 number of times), or variable (the item occurs from a minimum number of times
 to a maximum number of times). If a variable field is used it must be the last
 in a record definition and if a variable record is used it must be the last in
 the schema definition.

 A field may be defined as of type 'string', 'integer' or 'decimal'. A decimal
 type has a further property of 'scale' which defines the number of digits to
 the right of the decimal point.
