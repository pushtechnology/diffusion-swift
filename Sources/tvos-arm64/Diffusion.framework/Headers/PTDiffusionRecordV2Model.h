/**
 @brief A data model based upon a schema.

 A read only model can be created from any PTDiffusionRecordV2 object using the
 PTDiffusionRecordV2#modelWithSchema: method. The model then provides direct
 access to the fields within the data. Fields may be accessed either by
 explicitly specifying the record and field occurrence or by specifying a key of
 the form:
 
 `recordName(recordIndex).fieldName(fieldIndex)`

 Indexes start from 0 and if omitted then 0 is assumed. The record name may also
 be omitted, in which case the first record definition. This form of addressing
 is useful when there is only one record definition.

 Examples of valid keys include:
 
 | Key                         | Meaning                                                                       |
 | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | `Address(4).AddressLine(3)` | The 4th `AddressLine` occurrence within the 5th `Address` record.             |
 | `Address.Name`              | The first (or only) `Name` field within the first (or only) `Address` record. |
 | `AddressLine(1)`            | The 2nd `AddressLine` field within the first (or only) record.                |
 | `Name`                      | The first (or only) `Name` field within the first (or only) record.           |

 The #recordCountWithRecordName:error: and
 #fieldCountWithRecordName:recordIndex:fieldName:error: methods are useful for
 determining the actual number of occurrences of variable multiplicity items.
